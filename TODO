TODO!

- Move much or all of global state to per-Perl-interpreter storage.
- Concurrent Lua execution with multiple Lua interpreters?
- ithread-safety?
- Type conversion between Perl and Lua - Tables are hashes AND arrays. The fun!
- Get/set syntax for Perl lexicals in Lua?
  => A way to efficiently stash the PAD offsets
- The reverse?
- Improved scanning/lexing for finding the end of the Lua blocks.
- Wrapping Lua functions for Perl
- Wrapping Perl functions for Lua
- Find a way to avoid having to create full-blown Lua functions out of snippets
  and correspondingly find a more efficient way of executing them than lua_getglobal
  (IOW lookup by name).
  => Update: Now using Lua references for this. Quite a bit cleaner, but no more
     efficient. Guess that'll be the best we can do for now.
